/*
 * Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is
 * the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the
 * features(fields and methods) of another class.
 * 
 * Important terminology:
 * 
 * Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as a
 * superclass(or a base class or a parent class). Sub Class: The class that
 * inherits the other class is known as a subclass(or a derived class, extended
 * class, or child class). The subclass can add its own fields and methods in
 * addition to the superclass fields and methods. Reusability: Inheritance
 * supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new
 * class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that we
 * want, we can derive our new class from the existing class. By doing this, we
 * are reusing the fields and methods of the existing class. How to use
 * inheritance in Java
 * 
 * The keyword used for inheritance is extends.
 * 
 * Syntax :
 * 
 * class derived-class extends base-class { //methods and fields }
 *
