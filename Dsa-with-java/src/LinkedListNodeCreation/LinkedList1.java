/*
 * 
 * Representation of Linked Lists: A linked list is represented by a pointer to
 * the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head of the
 * linked list. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head points
 * to NULL.
 * 
 * Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
 * 
 * A Data Item (we can store integer, strings, or any type of data). Pointer (Or
 * Reference) to the next node (connects one node to another) or An address of
 * another node In C, we can represent a node using structures. Below is an
 * example of a linked list node with integer data. In Java or C#, LinkedList
 * can be represented as a class and a Node as a separate class. The LinkedList
 * class contains a reference of Node class type.
 * 
 * /* Three nodes have been allocated dynamically. We have references to these
 * three blocks as head, second and third
 * 
 * llist.head second third | | | | | | +----+------+ +----+------+ +----+------+
 * | 1 | null | | 2 | null | | 3 | null | +----+------+ +----+------+
 * +----+------+
 */

//llist.head.next=second; // Link first node with
// the second node

/*
 * Now next of the first Node refers to the second. So they both are linked.
 * 
 * llist.head second third | | | | | | +----+------+ +----+------+ +----+------+
 * | 1 | o-------->| 2 | null | | 3 | null | +----+------+ +----+------+
 * +----+------+
 */

//second.next=third; // Link second node with the third node

/*
 * Now next of the second Node refers to third. So all three nodes are linked.
