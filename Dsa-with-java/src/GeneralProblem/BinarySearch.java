/*
 * Binary Search Approach:
 * 
 * Binary Search is a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly
 * dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the
 * information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(Log
 * n).
 * 
 * Binary Search Algorithm: The basic steps to perform Binary Search are:
 * 
 * Begin with the mid element of the whole array as a search key. If the value
 * of the search key is equal to the item then return an index of the search
 * key. Or if the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of
 * the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise, narrow it to
 * the upper half. Repeatedly check from the second point until the value is
 * found or the interval is empty.
